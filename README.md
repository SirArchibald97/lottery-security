# lottery-security
A university project where I implemented several security features into a simple lottery web application. The application is written in Python using 
the Flask web framework.

## Security Measures
Some of the security features we were tasked with imeplementing include:
- Validating user input such as email addresses, passwords with requirements, and phone numbers
- Custom error handling
- Hashing passwords with salting
- Generating encryption keys for users to encrypt and decypt other user data
- Authentication using email addresses, passwords, time-based PINs, and reCAPTCHA
- Managing user sessions and controlling user access
- Implementing role based access control 
- Monitoring and logging user activity
- Securing random data generation
- Securing browser behaviour with loading external resources
